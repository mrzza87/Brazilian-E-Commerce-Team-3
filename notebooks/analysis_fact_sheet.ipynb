    "\n",
    "| **Code** | **Hypothesis** |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **H1 (Product Category Hypothesis)** | Certain product categories systematically receive more negative reviews due to product quality issues. |\n",
    "| **H2 (Seller Performance Hypothesis)** | Certain sellers consistently generate higher dissatisfaction and more low review scores. |\n",
    "| **H3 (Delivery & Logistics Hypothesis)** | Delivery delays, long delivery distances, and SLA violations contribute to lower review scores and customer dissatisfaction. |\n",
    "| **H4 (Revenue & Churn Financial Hypothesis)** | Customer dissatisfaction directly translates into lost revenue, higher churn rates, lower lifetime value, and long-term business losses. |\n",

    "## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Glossary of Business Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Term** | **Definition** |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Churn** | The rate at which customers stop purchasing from the business over time. High churn indicates customers are not retained. |\n",
    "| **LTV (Lifetime Value)** | The total revenue a business expects to earn from a customer throughout their relationship with the business. |\n",
    "| **CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)** | A more detailed version of LTV that accounts for revenue, cost to serve, retention rate, and profit margin over time. CLV = (Average Revenue per Customer √ó Gross Margin √ó Customer Lifespan). |\n",
    "| **Operational Delay** | The difference between the estimated and actual delivery date. High operational delay can drive customer dissatisfaction. |\n",
    "| **Delivery Distance** | The physical distance between seller and customer locations; longer distances often correlate with longer delivery times. |\n",
    "| **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** | The target delivery time committed to customers. Violations of SLA lead to delivery delays and potential dissatisfaction. |\n",
    "| **Revenue at Risk** | The potential revenue loss if negative customer experiences continue without intervention. |\n",
    "| **Financial Impact Modeling** | Estimating financial losses or gains based on business scenarios such as churn reduction, delivery optimization, and seller quality improvements. |\n",
    "| **Operational Cost Savings** | Reduction in company expenses through improved processes, faster deliveries, or better resource utilization. |\n",
    "| **Seller Quality Assurance** | Programs to monitor and ensure sellers meet product quality and service expectations to reduce customer complaints. |\n",
