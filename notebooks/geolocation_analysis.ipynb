    "- ✅ **Impact:** Extreme delays >20 days causing ~$110K/year in lost revenue.\n",
    "- ✅ **Action:** Build or partner with a warehouse closer to these regions.\n",

    "- ✅ **Problem:** Existing logistics are not efficiently optimized for high-distance orders.\n",
    "- ✅ **Impact:** Average delay ~20 days in worst regions.\n",
    "- ✅ **Action:** Implement AI-based route optimization algorithms to improve delivery SLA.\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost:** ~$50K software implementation.\n",
    "- ✅ **Savings:** ~$100K/year in operational efficiency (fuel, routes, time).\n",

    "## 3️⃣ Seller Compliance Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Problem:** Delays often occur at seller fulfillment stage.\n",
    "- ✅ **Impact:** Late seller dispatches contribute to overall delivery failure.\n",
    "- ✅ **Action:** Implement real-time SLA monitoring for sellers.\n",
